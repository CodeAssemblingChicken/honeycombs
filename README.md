# Honeycombs
Honeycombs is a puzzle game inspired by and based on [Hexcells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/Hexcells/).

The player's goal is to uncover all yellow hexagons that hide either a blue or gray cell.  
Gray cells display a number indicating how many blue cells are adjacent to it.  
Additional hints make every puzzle solvable without guessing.

Deviating from the original, this version includes different puzzles as well as a level editor (currently not really usable), allowing players to create their own riddles.
